## Steps to Reproduce (how you used this tool)

<!--

## Expected Behavior

<!--What you expected to happen-->

Runs to completion without error.

## Actual Behavior

<!--What you actually see-->

```text
If the tool outputs a large string of disturbing red color error logs,
take all the error logs with the previous few line of non-error logs 
in the log file or terminal, and paste them here.
```

<!--
(Optional)
Log files can be a big help, so if you don't mind the trouble,
please upload the log file to one of the following sites and paste the URL here.

It would be great if you could open the debug log settings
(config "log_level: debug" in global settings file)
and re-run the plan for generating log file with debug logs.
