# Detailed Plan Configuration

This page contains all details and cautions about plan configuration:
which field is required (must be set) in one rule, what value can a field takes...
If you are confused about usage of a rule, the answer is most likely written on this page of the document.
(Can't find what you want? [Ask questions](https://github.com/boholder/puntgun/issues) to remind us to improve the documentation.)

## Tool Scope Consensus

### Time Type Values

All the time type values user configured for the tool, generated by the tool, are taken at **UTC+0** (i.e. Greenwich Mean Time Zone).
(But in general you don't need to be too concerned about a few hours' deviation in filter rules setting or so.)

There are three available time formats for configuration:

1. `2022-01-01 01:01:01` -> `datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)`
2. `2022-01-01` -> `datetime.date(2022, 1, 1)` (the time part is `00:00:00`)
3. `2022-01-01T01:01:01Z` -> `datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)`

## User Source Rules

### ids

* Where to get them? Somehow you can get them from another automatic twitter processing tool.
  If you want to get one user's id manually, maybe you can find it in the [Twitter Web Client](https://twitter.com)'s
  [XHRs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en_US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) via browser developer console?
  And there are some online websites that allows you to get the id of a user with its name,
  google "Twitter user id" and you'll find them.

* The type of list elements can be `number` or `string`.

## User Filter Rules

### follower, following

* At least one of `less_than`, `more_than` fields need to be set.
* This sounds not straightforward, but the `less_than` needs to be bigger than the `more_than` because the order of comparison is:
  `more_than < number < less_than`
* The equal-to-edge cases (number=less_than or number=more_then) are regard as falsy (not trigger the rule).

## User Action Rules
