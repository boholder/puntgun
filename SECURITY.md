# Security Policy

This page is used to show which versions of the tool are affected by which vulnerabilities.
There are currently no vulnerabilities present.
It is recommended to update this tool to the latest version each time you run it 
(it is much easier to update with the help of [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please submit vulnerability or abuse reports via [issues](https://github.com/boholder/puntgun/issues). 
Responses and fixes for such issues will be prioritized over any other issues.
If the submitter determines that the problem is serious and should not directly disclose the specifics in public, 
please email the specifics to [current maintainer](mailto:boholder@anche.no) and create an issue without the specifics
(I generally check my emails once a week, but the creation of an issue can be notified immediately).

We apologize that we cannot give an exact expected fix time.
